//! Multiple producers, single consumer.
//!
//! The optimization assumes single consumer condition.
//!
//! **NOTE**: For SP / SC version [AsyncRx], [Rx], is not `Clone`, and without `Sync`,
//! Although can be moved to other thread, but not allowed to use send/recv while in Arc.
//!
//! The following code is OK :
//!
//! ``` rust
//! use crossfire::*;
//! async fn foo() {
//!     let (tx, rx) = mpsc::bounded_async::<usize>(100);
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         let _ = rx.recv().await;
//!     });
//!     drop(tx);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Because AsyncRx does not have Sync marker, using `Arc<AsyncRx>` will lose Send marker.
//!
//! For your safety, the following code **should not compile**:
//!
//! ``` compile_fail
//! use crossfire::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! async fn foo() {
//!     let (tx, rx) = mpsc::bounded_async::<usize>(100);
//!     let rx = Arc::new(rx);
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         let _ = rx.recv().await;
//!     });
//!     drop(tx);
//! }
//! ```
