## Unreleased

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-15

### Changed

- Refactor to drop dependency of crossbeam-channel, the underlayering is modified version of crossbeam-queue.

- Bounded channel speed receive massive boost.

- AsyncTx can convert back and forth with Tx, and AsyncRx can convert back and forth with Rx.

- Optimise for VM machine that only have 1 cpu.

- Use MaybeUninit to optimise the moving of large blob message for bounded channel, in nearly full scenario.

- Rename ReceiveFuture to RecvFuture, ReceiveTimeoutFuture to RecvTimeoutFuture.

### Removed

- Remove AsyncTx::send_blocking() and AsyncRx::recv_blocking(),
instead, you can use type conversion into Tx/Rx.

## [2.0.20] - 2025-08-17

### Added

- AsyncTxTrait: Add Into<AsyncSink<T>>

- AsyncRxTrait: Add Into<AsyncStream<T>>

### Fixed

- Change the behavior of AsyncSink::poll_send() and AsyncStream::poll_item(), to make sure
stream/sink wakers are notified, preventing deadlock from happening if user wants to cancel the operation.
Add explanation to the document.

- Defend against infinite loop when waking up all wakers, given the change of sink/stream.

## [2.0.19] - 2025-08-13

### Added

- Add capacity()

## [2.0.18] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed

- Change some atomic load ordering from Acquire to SeqCst to pass validation by Miri.

## [2.0.17] - 2025-08-08

### Fixed

- Reuse and cleanup waker as much as possible (for idle select scenario)

- Change some atomic store ordering from Release to SeqCst to avoid further trouble.

## [2.0.16] - 2025-08-04

### Added

- Add into_blocking()

- Add missing into_sink() for MAsyncTx.

- Add From for AsyncSink and AsyncStream.

## [2.0.15] - 2025-08-04

### Added

- Add missing conversion: MAsyncTx->AsyncTx and MTx->Tx

## [2.0.14] - 2025-08-03

### Changed

- Optimise bounded size 1 speed with backoff

- Updated benchmark result vs kanal to wiki

## [2.0.13] - 2025-07-24

### Fixed

- Fix a deadlock https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs/issues/22

### Added

- Allow type conversion from AsyncTx -> Tx, AsyncRx -> Rx

## [2.0.12] - 2025-07-18

### Fixed

- Fix a possible hang in LockedQueue introduced from v2.0.5

## [2.0.11] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- Add Deref/AsRef for sender & receiver type to ChannelShared

- Add is_full(), get_tx_count(), get_rx_count()

- Revert the removal of send_blocking() and recv_blocking() (will maintain through 2.0.x)

### Removed

- Remove DerefMut because it's no used.

### Fixed

- Fix send_timeout() in blocking context

## [2.0.10] yanked

published with the wrong branch, do not use.

## [2.0.9] - 2025-07-16

### Added

- Add is_disconnected() to sender and receiver type.

- Add Deref for AsyncSink to AsyncTx, and AsyncStream to AsyncRx, remove duplicated code.

### Fixed

- Fix a rare deadlock, when only one future in async runtime (for example channel async-blocking or blocking-async).
Runtime will spuriously wake up with changed Waker.

### Removed

- Remove send_blocking() & recv_blocking(), which is anti-pattern. (Calling function that blocks might lead to deadlock in async runtime)

## [2.0.8] - 2025-07-14

### Added

- AsyncStream: Add try_recv(), len() & is_empty()

## [2.0.7] - 2025-07-13

### Added

- AsyncStream: Add poll_item() for writing custom future, as a replacement to AsyncRx's poll_item(),
 but without the need of LockedWaker.

- Add AsyncSink::poll_send() for writing custom future, as a replacement to AsyncTx's poll_send(),
 but without the need of LockedWaker.

- Implement Debug & Display for all senders and receivers.

### Remove

- Hide LockedWaker, since AsyncRx::poll_item() and AsyncTx::poll_send() is hidden.

### Changed

- Optimise speed for SPSC & MPSC up to 60% (with WeakCell)

- Add execution time log to test cases.

### Fixed

- Fix LockedQueue empty flag (not affecting usage, just not accurate to internal test cases)

## [2.0.6] - 2025-07-10

### Added

- Support timeout and tested on async-std

### Changed

- mark make_recv_future() & make_send_future() deprecated.

- Change poll_send() & poll_item() to private function.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-07-09

### Added

- Add send_timeout() & recv_timeout() for async context

### Fixed

- AsyncRx: Fix rare case that message left on disconnect

- Fixed document typo and improve description.

### Changed

- Optimise RegistryMulti, with 20%+ speed improved on MPSC / MPMC

## [2.0.4] - 2025-07-08

### Changed

- Remove Sync marker in Tx, Rx, AsyncTx, AsyncRx to prevent misuse with Arc


## [2.0.3] - 2025-07-07

### Changed

- Remove duplicated code.

### Fixed

- AsyncRx should not have Clone.

- Protect against misuse of spsc/mpsc when user should use mpmc (avoiding deadlocks)

## [2.0.2] - 2025-07-05

### Added

- Add channels for blocking context (which equals to crossbeam)

### Changed

- Remove unused Clone for LockedWaker

### Fixed

- spsc: Add missing unsupported size=0 overwrites


## [2.0.1] - 2025-07-03

### Added

- Add timeout API for blocking context (by Zach Schoenberger)

### Changed

- Set min Rust version and edition in alignment with crossbeam (by Zach Schoenberger)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-27

### Added

- spsc module

- Benchmark suite written with criterion.

### Changed

- Refactor the API design. Unify sender and receiver types.

- Removal of macro rules and refactor SendWakers & RecvWakers into Enum, thus removal of generic type in Channelshared structure.

- Removal of the spin lock in LockedWaker. Simplifying the logic without losing performance.

- Rewrite the test cases with rstest.

### Removed

- Drop SelectSame module, because of hard to maintain, can be replace with future-select.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-19
