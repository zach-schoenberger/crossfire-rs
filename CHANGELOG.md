## Unreleased

### Added

### Removed

### Changed

### Fixed

## [2.0.12] - 2025-07-18

### Fixed

- Fix a possible hang in LockedQueue introduced from v2.0.5

## [2.0.11] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- Add Deref/AsRef for sender & receiver type to ChannelShared

- Add is_full(), get_tx_count(), get_rx_count()

- Revert the removal of send_blocking() and recv_blocking() (will maintain through 2.0.x)

### Removed

- Remove DerefMut because it's no used.

### Fixed

- Fix send_timeout() in blocking context

## [2.0.10] yanked

published with the wrong branch, do not use.

## [2.0.9] - 2025-07-16

### Added

- Add is_disconnected() to sender and receiver type.

- Add Deref for AsyncSink to AsyncTx, and AsyncStream to AsyncRx, remove duplicated code.

### Fixed

- Fix a rare deadlock, when only one future in async runtime (for example channel async-blocking or blocking-async).
Runtime will spuriously wake up with changed Waker.

### Removed

- Remove send_blocking() & recv_blocking(), which is anti-pattern. (Calling function that blocks might lead to deadlock in async runtime)

## [2.0.8] - 2025-07-14

### Added

- AsyncStream: Add try_recv(), len() & is_empty()

## [2.0.7] - 2025-07-13

### Added

- AsyncStream: Add poll_item() for writing custom future, as a replacement to AsyncRx's poll_item(),
 but without the need of LockedWaker.

- Add AsyncSink::poll_send() for writing custom future, as a replacement to AsyncTx's poll_send(),
 but without the need of LockedWaker.

- Implement Debug & Display for all senders and receivers.

### Remove

- Hide LockedWaker, since AsyncRx::poll_item() and AsyncTx::poll_send() is hidden.

### Changed

- Optimise speed for SPSC & MPSC up to 60% (with WeakCell)

- Add execution time log to test cases.

### Fixed

- Fix LockedQueue empty flag (not affecting usage, just not accurate to internal test cases)

## [2.0.6] - 2025-07-10

### Added

- Support timeout and tested on async-std

### Changed

- mark make_recv_future() & make_send_future() deprecated.

- Change poll_send() & poll_item() to private function.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-07-09

### Added

- Add send_timeout() & recv_timeout() for async context

### Fixed

- AsyncRx: Fix rare case that message left on disconnect

- Fixed document typo and improve description.

### Changed

- Optimise RegistryMulti, with 20%+ speed improved on MPSC / MPMC

## [2.0.4] - 2025-07-08

### Changed

- Remove Sync marker in Tx, Rx, AsyncTx, AsyncRx to prevent misuse with Arc


## [2.0.3] - 2025-07-07

### Changed

- Remove duplicated code.

### Fixed

- AsyncRx should not have Clone.

- Protect against misuse of spsc/mpsc when user should use mpmc (avoiding deadlocks)

## [2.0.2] - 2025-07-05

### Added

- Add channels for blocking context (which equals to crossbeam)

### Changed

- Remove unused Clone for LockedWaker

### Fixed

- spsc: Add missing unsupported size=0 overwrites


## [2.0.1] - 2025-07-03

### Added

- Add timeout API for blocking context (by Zach Schoenberger)

### Changed

- Set min Rust version and edition in alignment with crossbeam (by Zach Schoenberger)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-27

### Added

- spsc module

- Benchmark suite written with criterion.

### Changed

- Refactor the API design. Unify sender and receiver types.

- Removal of macro rules and refactor SendWakers & RecvWakers into Enum, thus removal of generic type in Channelshared structure.

- Removal of the spin lock in LockedWaker. Simplifying the logic without losing performance.

- Rewrite the test cases with rstest.

### Removed

- Drop SelectSame module, because of hard to maintain, can be replace with future-select.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-19

### Changed

- Migrate repo

From <http://github.com/qingstor/crossfire-rs> to <https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs>
